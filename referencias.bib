abstract = {In this paper, a virtual reality for vocational rehabilitation (VR4VR) system for individuals with disabilities is presented. VR4VR aims to enable job coaches to use immersive virtual environments to inexpensively and safely assess and train the job skills of individuals with disabilities. Several key system requirements and challenges are discussed, including the need for virtual 'distractor' stimuli to observe user behavior in unexpected situations, the need to make the virtual experience and 3D user interfaces adapt to the specific disabilities of the user, and the challenges in maintaining senses of presence and copresence, especially in individuals with cognitive disabilities. In this work, the chosen population includes individuals with autism spectrum disorder, traumatic brain injury and severe mobility impairment. Using virtual reality enables safe immersion of potential employees in a range of scenarios they may encounter, long before they encounter them in a real job. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Using video game elements to improve user experience and user engagement in non-game applications is called " gamification " . This method of enriching human-computer interaction has been applied successfully in education, health and general business processes. However, it has not been established in industrial production so far. After discussing the requirements specific for the production domain we present two workplaces augmented with gamification. Both implementations are based on a common framework for context-aware assistive systems but exemplify different approaches: the visualization of work performance is complex in System 1 and simple in System 2. Based on two studies in sheltered work environments with impaired workers, we analyze and compare the systems' effects on work and on workers. We show that gamification leads to a speed-accuracy-tradeoff if no quality-related feedback is provided. Another finding is that there is a highly significant raise in acceptance if a straightforward visualization approach for gamification is used.},

Engagement is the main objective in applying gamification. The use of gamification and new technologies for enhancing the learning process will boost achievement in 3D architectural subjects for design, and convey and validate any architectural project. The researchers used virtual reality and software like Sketchfab, Unity, and Oculus Rift VR to enter virtual and immersive worlds that students used to enhance their architectural designs. To connect the technologies, the researchers used Unity for programming all the viewer behaviors and the virtual world interactivity.

However, between flow theory, selfdetermination theory or Bartle's player types there is much room for speculation regarding the mechanics required for successful gamification, which in turn leads to increased motivation. For our study, we selected a gamified solution for motion training (an exergame) where the playful design elements are extremely simple. The contribution is three-fold: we show best practices from the state of the art, present a study analyzing the effects of simple gamification mechanics on a quantitative and on a qualitative level and discuss strategies for playful design in therapeutic movement games.},

abstract = {Dengue is a global public health challenge. The dengue virus is transmitted mainly by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is also a vector of other diseases such as zika, chikungunya and urban yellow fever. Its transmission dynamics is complex, involving several actors, factors and processes. Acting against vectors is still an important strategy, mainly due to limitations in efficacy and accessibility of vaccines. We believe that including and awareness of population is an important factor to address the problem. This project aims to design and develop a serious game to support actions and strategies based on prevention and epidemiological surveillance. In order to raise awareness about vector ecology and disease transmission dynamics, the game design presents information and seeks to encourage behavior changes in a playful environment. Moreover, gamification strategies are being used to stimulate concrete actions in real world. A mix of 2D-based game, augmented reality, virtual reality and the real world itself, will provide the proper environment to offer fun with the purpose of helping to deal with this complex problem. This paper presents the game design and current development stage. The artifacts are being developed in an iterative and incremental way, involving activities of conception, design, construction/prototyping and evaluation. Results include the game design, prototypes and the release of a demo version.},

They transform existing technologies, relationships, and places into platforms for gameplay. While the design of mixed reality games has received increasing attention across multiple disciplines, a focus on the collaborative potential of mixed reality formats, such as augmented and alternate reality games, has been lacking. We believe the CSCW community can play an essential and unique role in examining and designing the next generation of mixed reality games and technologies that support them.

We are facing an unexplored field, given the recent emergence and growth of these fields, as this type of evidence is concerned. To do this, we have studied the assessment tools recommended by leading authors and researchers User Experience (UX), Playability and Player Experience (PX). Of these instruments and techniques they have been selected instruments and methods suitable for this type of videogame, it has been proposed a methodology and it has been tested in a field study with real potential users. As a case study, it has made the assessment Progrezz, a platform pioneer in the gamification of real social actions, based on the play model of Ingress, using as support for this technology mobile geographic location with the emerging technology of augmented reality. For this they previously discussed a number of issues related to the context and framework of the project in order to justify the existence and approach also explain the decisions taken during the approach, development and implementation. Finally, an evaluation guide has been proposed, which allows a multidimensional measure the UX/PX geolocated mobile games with AR.},

abstract = {Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) is an innovative way of disseminating knowledge to millions of students around the world. Despite being an excellent learning tool with global reach, MOOC has its own set of limitations which results in incredibly low rate of course completion. Conservative techniques of content presentation (fixed video, audio, scripts) lack personalization and interaction. There is a need for MOOC to embrace advanced learning techniques to provide more engaging experience to its learners. This paper delves into three such techniques namely, Augmented Reality, Adaptive Learning and Gamification. It illustrates the positive impact of these techniques in present learning scenario and studies how these techniques are being adopted by MOOC to generate interactive and more engaging content.},

abstract = {The development and use of Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) has increased considerably over the past decades. Following that trend, many research findings have shown the benefits of using VLE during the learning process. Nevertheless, there are important problems that hinder their use requiring further investigation. Among them, one of the main problems is the inappropriate use of these systems by students. The boredom, lack of interest, monotony, lack of motivation, among other factors, ultimately causes students to behave inappropriately and lead them to a lower performance. In this context, the proposed study investigates whether it is possible to reduce undesirable behaviors and increase performance of students through the use of game mechanics (i.e. gamification). We develop a VLE, E-Game, that can turn on/off several game mechanics, such as points, badges, levels and so on. A case study was conducted with two groups of students to investigate their behavior during their interaction with E-Game with and without gamification. The results indicate that the gamification implemented by E-Game contributed to improve student performance in the case of boys. Yet, improvement was not observed in the case of girls. Furthermore, it was not possible to conclude whether the use of gamification helps to prevent inappropriate student behavior, and therefore, further studies and experiments are needed.

abstract = {Gamification is an ever more popular method to increase motivation and user experience in real-world settings. It is widely used in the areas of marketing, health and education. However, in production environments, it is a new concept. To be accepted in the industrial domain, it has to be seamlessly integrated in the regular work processes. In this work we make the following contributions to the field of gamification in production: (1) we analyze the state of the art and introduce domain-specific requirements; (2) we present two implementations gamifying production based on alternative design approaches; (3) these are evaluated in a sheltered work organization. The comparative study focuses acceptance, motivation and perceived happiness. The results reveal that a pyramid design showing each work process as a step on the way towards a cup at the top is strongly preferred to a more abstract approach where the processes are represented by a single circle and two bars.},

As a result production workers still have to rely on their skills and expertise. While un-impaired workers may cope well with this situation, elderly or impaired persons in production environments need context-sensitive assistance. The contribution of the research presented here is three-fold: (1) We provide a framework for context-aware assistive systems in production environments. These systems are based on motion recognition and use projection and elements from game design (gamification) to augment work. (2) Based on this framework we describe a prototype with respect to both the physical and the software implementation.

This is true both for mastering the device and even more importantly for learning to use it in specific environments. Such training usually requires external help which is not always available, can be costly, and attempts to navigate without such preparation can be dangerous. Here we will demonstrate several games which were developed in our lab as part of the training programs for the EyeCane, which augments the traditional White-Cane with additional distance and angles. These games avoid the above-mentioned problems of availability, cost and safety and additionally utilize gamification techniques to boost the training process. Visitors to the demonstration will use these devices to perform simple in-game virtual tasks such as finding the exit from a room or avoiding obstacles while wearing blindfolds.},

It then extends the use of game elements into virtual reality in which the synthesizing of the old culture with a new one is the main accomplishment being sought. Firstly, gamification maps a community engagement plan while shape grammars serve for spatial analysis of the narrow alleys of Kashgar.

Therefore, in this capstone project, we aim to create a gamify Website to serve as a platform for different users to interact, engage and showcase their creativity. Significance of the study are first, there have been several studies on gamification in e-commerce and e-learning literature but our study is in the Malaysian context, focused on the effects of gamification to learning Science, Technology, Mathematics and Engineering (STEM), through a gamification website. Also, by creating a community of potential designers/creators, to increase interest in the learning of STEM (technology).},
